                <p>My name is Muhamad Akmal bin Arshad, for me the name is kinda cool but disturbing at the same time because everyone may misunderstand by calling my father name, but I get used to it. Iâ€™m 20 years old. My family and I stay at Sungai Petani, Kedah and I was born here on June 26, 2000.  I have 2 siblings which both are girl and I am the youngest and the only boy in my family. My hobby is doing outdoor and indoor activities such as playing football, futsal, and badminton. My Favourite color is blue and black. The first thing i want to do is to get successful in the future to make my parent happy and proud. Now I study at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UITM) Merbok, Kedah in Diploma Of Information System and on the last semester.</p>
